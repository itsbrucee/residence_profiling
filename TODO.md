# TODO: Add Modern Notification for Delete Action

- [x] Add helper method `_showDeleteSnackBar()` in `lib/pages/resident_details_page.dart` for modern delete notification (trash icon, red background, rounded corners, shadow, 3s duration).
- [x] Update `_delete()` in `lib/pages/resident_details_page.dart` to show the notification before navigating back.
- [x] Update `_deleteSelected()` in `lib/pages/residents_lists_page.dart` to replace existing SnackBar with modern delete notification.
- [ ] Test the delete notifications in both single and batch delete scenarios.
